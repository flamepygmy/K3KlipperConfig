Assuming *nothing* is calibrated except perhaps homing, then this is the order of things:

  1. extruder steps calibration
  2. input shaper calibration with accelerometer
  3. calibrating flow for at least ONE filament using the first layer 'squish' independent method

Once we have at least one properly flow calibrated filament, we can calibrate proper first layer squish.

Per build plate (beacon):
  4. beacon calibration
  5. calibrating first layer 'squish'

Per filament (for other filaments):
  (6). calibrating flow (prefer still the 'squish' independent method), see (3)
  (7). verifying first layer 'squish' (note: THIS should be filament independent assuming flow is correct), see (5).
       we do this step just to verify that nothing changed with this.. shouldnt' have
  8. calibrating pressure advance
  9. shrinking calibration
