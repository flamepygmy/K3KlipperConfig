We are following the Klipper one on this one: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html with a twist

  1. set the 'pressure_advance_smooth_time' to what should be roughly proper for your extruder prior to testing
  2. for example for sherpa micro, I use 0.01, DFA should be something like 0.017-0.020, YMMV
  3. follow the instructions on Klipper website, but DO NOT issue the SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT command
  4. instead we print at close to regular intended print speeds (for example 200mm/s) and
     already calibrated acceleration values from input shaper tuning
  5. issue
     TUNING_TOWER COMMAND=SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE PARAMETER=ADVANCE START=0 FACTOR=.005
  6. set layer height to 0.75% of nozzle width (for 0.5mm nozzle 0.375mm)
  7. set infill to 0%
  8. the rest of it we follow the Klipper documentation
  9. set the pressure_advance custom GCODE to the slicer for this specific filament as the value can be
     different from filament to other:
         SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE ADVANCE=<best value>

  9. set also the smooth time for ALL filaments as some filaments may use something else:
         SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE SMOOTH_TIME=<value>

       for example for TPU or some such you may have to use a different value possibly here
