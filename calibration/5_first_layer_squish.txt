We are using the Ellis / Prusa method here.

https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/first_layer_squish.html

  1. set extrusion width to 120% of your nozzle width
  2. set layer height to 0.20 (beacon -> we should be able to rely on this)
  3. add a cube of 20x20x0.25 size
  4. set instance count to 9
  5. set the arrange distance to something that keeps a good distance between the 'cubes'
  6. arrange the cubes (should cover most of the bed)
  7. set print speeds to something reasonable like 60mm/s
  8. cooling can be turned off
  9. use traditional slicing (do not use arachne or other dynamic line width methods)

  10. start the print (usual pre-print stuff should be done like z_tilt_adjust, bed_mesh_calibrate prior)
  11. as the printer is printing the flat cubes, inspect the results and adjust the Z offset from
      the interface (Fluidd, MainSail) to optimize result
  12. if best result not yet found, goto (9)

 The best result is where the lines are still visible, but there are no gaps between them. There should
 be no 'lifted' pieces where there is too much squish and the filament near the edges start to 'push up'.

 There can be small gaps near the edges as those are hard to fill *exactly* unless using arachne or other
 variable line-width stuff. In terms of lines we are mostly concerned near the center. For the 'push up'
 we are interested anywhere as that's a sign of too much squishing and the filament is climbing over other
 lines/areas.

 Once we have the Z-offset, record that and it should be saved into the 'model_offset' of the saved beacon
 config for that specific plate/thermal combination. First layer squish should be done for each config
 separately.
