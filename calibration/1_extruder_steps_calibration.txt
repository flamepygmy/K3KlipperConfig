Getting this exactly right is not SUPER important, because filament flow calibration can be used to offset
results, BUT if the results are not accurate and you swap say extruders, then suddenly all your filament
flow calibration results are now suspect to being off if they were calibrated vs. extruder steps that
weren't exactly right.

Do this with your cheapest filament :-)

 1. set the 'full_steps_per_rotation' correctly for the motor, 200 for 1.8 and 400 for 0.9
 2. set the correct 'gear_ratio', for example sherpa mini 8t is 50:8
 3. set the desired 'microsteps' value for example 16
 4. set initial 'rotation_distance' if you know it from:

      rotation_distance = <full_steps_per_rotation> * <microsteps> / <steps_per_mm>

 5. restart klipper

 6. move the bed as low as possible
 7. remove nozzle
 8. extrude enough filament so that they come outside of the bottom part of the extruder
 9. cut the filament as flush with the base of the hotend as possible
 10. extrude 500mm of filament, gently guide it so that it doesn't snag anywhere

     M83
     G92 E0.0
     G1 E500 F350

11. cut the filament as flush with the base of the hotend as possible
 12. measure the length of the filament as accurately as possible -> filament_meas
 13. calculate new rotation_distance with formula:

    rotation_distance = original_rotation_distance * filament_meas / 500

 14. if (filament_meas / 500) equals very close to 1.0, at some point you have to make a decision
    to stop the process -> stop

 15. set the new rotation_distance into the klipper config
 16. restart klipper
 17. goto (10) (filament already cut flush)
