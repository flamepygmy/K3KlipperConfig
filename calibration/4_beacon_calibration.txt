Follow the beacon calibration flow with some specific twists:

  1. set 'cal_nozzle_z' to 0.2 in [beacon]
  2. restart Klipper
  3. use 0.2mm feeler gauge for the test, make sure that you have just one of the feeler gauges or not accidentally stacked 2 for example
  4. run beacon calibrate against the feeler gauge
  5. what we are searching for is the very first Z position where you hear 'tick tick tick' as you slide the feeler gauge under the
     nozzle
  6. to that end we move the nozzle closer and closer, when we hear the ticking sound we move down to higher resolution stepping and move the bed
     further away from the nozzle
  7. once we hear no sound again, we move next higher resolution stepping (smaller step value) and goto (6)

  Once we are at the highest resolution of movement, we want to find the Z offset where the sound is not heard and then by moving
  the bed closer with the highest resolution step you start to hear the sound... then that's your calibrated position (the one giving the
  sound).

  This way, we have a standard way of doing this always more or less the same way assuming the bed is relatively level to begin with
  AND the bed doesn't have debris on it.

  If this is first calibratiobn ever, it may be required to do this first, then running z_tilt_adjust to level the bed and calibrate
  AGAIN, but now with level bed. If the bed is at the tilt, then there is slight Z offset between what beacon is measuring and at which
  height the nozzle is.

  This one we save to the config.

  Note: this is not the proper 'squish' value yet, but it's usually quite close and atleast somewhat usable directly.
